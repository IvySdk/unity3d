 @discussion creditInfo is a dictionary with the following key-value pairs:
 
 "credits" - (int) The number of credits the user has Earned since the last didReceiveOfferwallCredits event that returned YES. Note that the credits may represent multiple completions (see return parameter).
 
 "totalCredits" - (int) The total number of credits ever earned by the user.
 
 "totalCreditsFlag" - (BOOL) In some cases, we won’t be able to provide the exact amount of credits since the last event (specifically if the user clears the app’s data). In this case the ‘credits’ will be equal to the "totalCredits", and this flag will be YES.
 
 @param creditInfo Offerwall credit info.
 
 @return The publisher should return a BOOL stating if he handled this call (notified the user for example). if the return value is NO, the 'credits' value will be added to the next call.
